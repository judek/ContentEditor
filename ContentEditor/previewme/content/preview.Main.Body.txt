--+++ Come experience for yourself the unique experience
It's a brave new coffeehouse world, and not because there's a Starbucks on every civilized corner. Intrepid indie establishments, like the Bag & Brew, offer free wireless internet access, without requiring you to sign on, create a password, agree to a contract, or god forbid, pay. It's enough to love the place, regardless of coffee quality or decor. But in addition to offering fine Lavassa coffee, Bag & Brew has great food, great art by local artists, plush couches, a fireplace, books, Scrabble, Chess and Battleship -the list goes on. 
Bag & Brew owners Victoria and Dan Kosirog have created a coffeehouse sanctuary that is also a community-oriented establishment. Local bands play live music; book clubs; and everyday we have the handbag exchange program. A large flat-panel television hangs in the back. We offer plenty of space indoors and out for pre-arranged meetings with your small group or whittling away at your laptop, and a station by the counter sells Bag & Brew's wares, along with greeting cards and gift baskets. Bag & Brew features a wide menu of smoothies, sandwiches, breakfast fare, homemade offerings like chili and soup, and pastries, ice cream, and a kids' menu.
